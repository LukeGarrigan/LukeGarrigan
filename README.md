Hello, I'm Luke, welcome to my Github. What a pleasure it must be for you to see such beautiful code, in every repo! Ha, just kidding, don't go snooping around though - there's a lot that I'm not proud of. 

So, I am a software engineer by trade currently working at [Netcall](https://www.netcall.com/) predominantly writing C# and Vue.js. In my spare time I do a bit of hacking as you may see from the odd commit here on Github. 

- ðŸ“— I write blogs on my personal blogsite at [codeheir.com](https://www.codeheir.com/). 
- ðŸ’¬ I have a portfolio website that can be found at [lukegarrigan.com](https://www.lukegarrigan.com) (I coded this in a day so don't judge too much ðŸ¤£)
